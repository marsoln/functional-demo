# some functional demo with react

## Intro

- install pkg via yarn `yarn install` or npm `npm i`
- run dev server `yarn start` or `npm start`
- view it in your browser `http://localhost:8080` (if the port is not conflict)

## demos for now

- drag and select
- click float
- polygon draw
- ease-in-out function

## why scss files?

I didn't use any `sass`/`scss` compiler, instead of them, i used `postcss` with `next-css` nesting/nested syntax.
But my editor(vscode) pointed out the nested syntax as errors for `css` format, so i had to pleasure it by changing the file format to `scss`.
